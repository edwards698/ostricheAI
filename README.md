OpenAI GPT models and Meta's LLaMA models on a Raspberry Pi 5. This guide focuses on efficient ways to interact with these models by leveraging APIs and lightweight model setups.

# Set Your Environment 
Before starting, make sure your Raspberry Pi 5 is set up with the following:
To get started with your Raspberry Pi, you’ll need the following:

* a power supply
* boot media (e.g. a microSD card with ample storage and speed) atleast 32GB and above.

You can set up your Raspberry Pi as an interactive computer with a desktop, or as a headless computer accessible only over the network. To set your Raspberry Pi up headless, you don’t need any additional peripherals: you can preconfigure a hostname, user account, network connection, and SSH when you install an operating system. If you want to use your Raspberry Pi directly, you’ll need the following additional accessories:

* display
* cable to connect your Raspberry Pi to your display
* keyboard
* mouse
